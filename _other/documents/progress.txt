  ── To Do:

  * Clean up colour schemas (globals.css)
  * Restyle Login

  ── Fixed:
  * New Profile button on Profile page is not "default" style
  * New Artifact button on Artifact page is not "default" style
  * Audit badges on Profile page: wrong colours

* CIS Controls page: Reorder pie segments, so that #1 is on top, and the others follow in clockwise order.
* All Pages: Removed ID column from master table, and moved to detail tab pane.
* Sidebar: urgent tasks: tasks which are past due date / within 10% of being at their due date.
* CIS safeguards page: Details now opens up in a detail pane under the table
* Fixed more bugs related to IDs going from Int to UUIDs (String).

* CIS controls page: Can you make a third donut, an outer donut of the same size as the inner donut. With this new outer donut, I want to be able to mark pie segments as being inactive, and/or to combine several segments into one larger one.
* 
* CIS safeguards page: there should be a button that attaches a Safeguard to a Task. Clicking on the button should open a popup dialog, where you can see avaliable tasks, and select one from the list.
* Task page: under the action tab, there should be a button where the task can be assigned to a Control Safeguard.

* Sidebar: clicking on a task under Current tasks, correctly redirects to the task page, and shows the selected task in the bottom detail pane. However, the table pagination is not updated correctly. If the current pagination is on page 3, and the selected task i on page 1, the pagination should be updated to page 1


* Organization page: the id column should be removed. ID should be showed (in a non-editable) field in the details tab. Same on the Profiles, Tasks, Asset, audit-trail, pages.
* Sidebar: urgent tasks, should show tasks which are either past their due date, or within 10% of being at their due date.
CIS safeguards page: clicking on a row in the table, unfolds the detail data under the row being clicked. Can you move the detail data to under the table.

----------
The Events table should also have an "importance" column, with values: LOW, MIDDLE, HIGH. Which should also be included in the Audit Trail table.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Page Task: The Artifact tab. There should be a button to add an artifact to the task. This should open a pop-up. similar to the one of the Artifact page under Task/Add to Task.
A Search field, and a list of current tasks to select from.

Page Profile: The events generated when making changes to a task, should be connected to the task, not the profile

Page Organization: The events generated when making changes to a task, should be connected to the task, not the organization

Page Organization: The events generated when making changes to a profile, should be connected to the profile, not the organization

* Page Artifact : When creating a new Artifact, it should create an Audit Event with LOW importance.

* Page Audit Trail: the table is too wide. It exceeds the screen's width. Possible because the message column and entity columns have no width restrictions.

* Page Incomming Files. The table needs pagination. Maximum 10 rows per page.

* Create three new pages: 1) About Compliance Circle; 2) Privacy Policy; 3) Terms of Service

Create content for Privacy Policy and Terms of Service
