ToDo:
* Rethink users/profile pages. DO we need two? There is already login handling on the profile page. Perhaps remove from there?
* Page CIS18/Controls
    * Some space between Risk Score legends and Show Inactive

1) The combine button should be a <Button variant="default"
2) Under the group name, is a list of the controls in the group. This line is too long, perhaps break up so only one control per line.
3) Clicking on the group should popup a dialog where the group can be given a name, to replace the default name "group 1", "group 2".
4) There is an error: after a group has been created, you can select the group and it'll let you click the combine button again.
5) The groups should be stored in the database. Create new tables or columns in existing tables if required.

Jeg skrev en kommentar til hver link, for netop at beskrive hvad der dokumenteres.

1+2) "Her fra USA: republikanske vælgere og regioner (stater, byer, counties, etc.) med republikansk flertal får flere børn end demokratiske vælgere og regioner med demokratisk flertal."

& 3) "Generelt vægter republikanske vælgere bare familie (ægteskab, børn) meget højere end demokratiske vælgere. Så det er ganske naturligt det bliver afspejlet i flere børn."

Det er i det hele taget trivielt at lave en opgørelse over hvor start lagde deres stemme og fødselsraten i starterne.

Spørgsmålet er måske mere hvad der er den underliggende faktor der bestemmer dette udfald. Måske republikanere bare værdsætter familie og børn højere. Kan også være at demokrater er mere urbane, og byer har lavere fødselsrate end forstæder og landområder.


Vi ved fra andre kilder at republikanske vælgere generelt er mere konservative og mere religiøse.


Det er en selv-rapportering.

Også en udvikling der ses i Europa:












AI slop her og AI slop der. Som du kan se er det mest fra kilder som:

Family Studies,
CDC Wonder (officielle US statestikker), Bureau of Labor Statiscs, US Census, og andre officielle amerikansk statestikbanker.
Center for Disease Control and Prevention
National Center for Health Statistics
Statista
Financial Times
National Survey of Family Growth

- det er ikke svært at finde, hvis du gider bruge 2 sek. Hvilke du nok ikke gider, siden du ikke har posted en eneste kilde selv.


[url=https://elementalenergy.substack.com/p/world-first-thorium-molten-salt-reactor]World First: Thorium Molten Salt Reactor in China confirmed[/url]

Påstanden om Molten Salt Nuclear Reactor er fra Financial Times (How China wants to create a 'Polar Silk Road' through the Arctic). Det er kun rygter, af hvilke grund jeg skriver "angiveligt"


https://zoom.us/j/91667468629?pwd=T2hGQVloWExQcDFBVEZYNEEvUjRWQT09

Sydkorea (Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) og Samsung Heavy Industries) siger også (i 2025) de har et design på en 174,000m³ LNG drevet af en lille modular molten salt reactor. [url=https://www.imarine.cn/199460.html]The world's first nuclear-powered LNG carrier has received certification (Mandarin)[/url]. Omend det vil tage nogle år at få den færdig.

Der er i øvrigt et dansk firma der arbejder på det: [url=https://www.copenhagenatomics.com/]Copenhagen Atomics[/url]. De har dog vist aldrig produceret noget.

The Events table should also have an "importance" column, with values: LOW, MIDDLE, HIGH. Which should also be included in the Audit Trail table.
