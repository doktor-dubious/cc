── Wednesday 25 Feb
* Login Page (continued)
  -> Redo to use the "Better Auth" library (major) (continued)
  -> Use Social Media login. Microsoft Azure & Google. (continued)
      -> Google: cc@predictioninstitute.com / Zx81sjdsy!!
      -> Microsoft (portal.azure.com/auth/login/) : 
  -> Language Localization added.
  -> Restyle to follow general style.
* Business Flow
    1) Adviser receives new Organization to onboard.
    2) First the Advisor must do a little preliminary research on Organization: business type, number of employees, etc.
       CC could perhaps assist with this (0% done).
    3) The Organization data is entered into CC's Organization Profile (100% done)
    4) The next step for the Advisor is to tweak the CIS Controls & Safeguards. Remove those which are irrelevant (100% done), combine others (100% done), rename some (0% done).
       To help with this task, CC can generate an initial starting point, by using the Organization Profile (0% done). Clicking on a button would apply the CC CIS template (0% done).
    5) The next step for the Advisor is to meet the customer (Organization) in a face-to-face meeting. The purpose of this meeting is to gather information for the GAP analysis.
       To aid the Advisor with this task, CC can generate a preliminary GAP aanalyse checklist (25% done). This is a printout (must be pretty & readable) or online (iPad) version of the active CIS Controls & Safeguards, with space for comments, etc.
    6) Having talked to the customer and gathered information for the GAP analysis, the Advisor can now refine the CIS Controls & Safeguards (100% done)
    7) Using this and other information CC can now generate a GAP analysis, during an interactive session with the Advisor (0% done)
    8) The next step is to activate the customer to get the compliance process going. For this purpose, first the Advisor creates a number of Profiles (100% done) for those responsible on the customer side. These Profiles do not have login access to CC.
    9) The Advisor can now generate Tasts individually on each CIS Safeguard (80% done), as well as Tasks not related to CIS (100%). The Advisor can also generate all Tasks related to a whole CIS Control (that is all the Safeguards) (0% done), or to all active Controls in one go (0% done).
    9) These Tasks can be connected to the Profiles (100% done), at which time Profile gets notified (0% done) that he has been assigned a Task.
    10) The rest is an ongoing process. The Profiles can upload Assets (25% done) to document Task completion status. The Advisor can verify the Asset, and if found relevant assosiate them with a Task (100% done) The Advisor can also upload his own Assets (in case the customer communicated through email, etc.) (25% done)
    11) The Advisor can then change the status of a Task (Open, Done, Closed, etc.) (100% done)
    12) The Advisor can communicate with other Advisors (if there are multiple Advisors for one Organization) (100% done - for v1, needs more bells for v2) and with Customers (0% done) with messages assosiated with a Task.
    13) The Advisor can generate status and progress reports based on the Tasks and CIS profile (0% done), as well as CONQ reports (0% done).
    14) There is an immutable Audit Trail, which documents all changes. Task created, deleted, changes status, etc. (100% done)
    15) The Advisor can get an overview of the statsus of all his Organizations from the Dashboard view (25% done)
* User Page: 
    1) The role select should have same width as other components
    2) Copy email verification (valid, unique) and password verification (strength) from the Profile Page to here.
    3) Changed Tab underline colour from purple to "foreground"
    4) When creating a Login, automatically also create a Profile. 
* Profile Page:
    1) Only show Login Tab pane on Profiles which are connected to a login
* Sidemenu : All menuitems + submenu items now have cursor=pointer on hover.
* Marked for deletion: 
    src/app/actions/authorization.ts
    src/lib/authorization.ts
    src/app/api/user/logout/route.ts
* Sidemenu : Language submenu: Greyscale flag icons, show in colour when on hover.
* Sidemenu : Show collapse/expand cursor in empty space of header (right of logo)
* General: Tried new font, Roboto vers Geist. Not sure which is best.
* Sidemenu : Added some animated icons to the Sidemenu / Dropdown (Logout, Blog)
* Sidemenu : Change theme not just on the sun/moon icon. Also the Theme menu text.
* Sidemenu : Profile Settings / Account : "Enable Two-Factor Authentication" -> <Button variant="defaut" + button text non selectable.




Do the same with the icon under Learn More -> Blog. Use this icon (https://animate-ui.com/docs/icons?search=link&icon=square-arrow-out-up-right) I already installed it with npx shadcn@latest add @animate-ui/icons-square-arrow-out-up-right


General Sidemenu is black, rest is dark grey. This is not the same as grok, www.better-auth.com
But dark grey is the color used by claude

Jeg skrev en kommentar til hver link, for netop at beskrive hvad der dokumenteres.

1+2) "Her fra USA: republikanske vælgere og regioner (stater, byer, counties, etc.) med republikansk flertal får flere børn end demokratiske vælgere og regioner med demokratisk flertal."

& 3) "Generelt vægter republikanske vælgere bare familie (ægteskab, børn) meget højere end demokratiske vælgere. Så det er ganske naturligt det bliver afspejlet i flere børn."

Det er i det hele taget trivielt at lave en opgørelse over hvor start lagde deres stemme og fødselsraten i starterne.

Spørgsmålet er måske mere hvad der er den underliggende faktor der bestemmer dette udfald. Måske republikanere bare værdsætter familie og børn højere. Kan også være at demokrater er mere urbane, og byer har lavere fødselsrate end forstæder og landområder.


Vi ved fra andre kilder at republikanske vælgere generelt er mere konservative og mere religiøse.


Det er en selv-rapportering.

Også en udvikling der ses i Europa:












AI slop her og AI slop der. Som du kan se er det mest fra kilder som:

Family Studies,
CDC Wonder (officielle US statestikker), Bureau of Labor Statiscs, US Census, og andre officielle amerikansk statestikbanker.
Center for Disease Control and Prevention
National Center for Health Statistics
Statista
Financial Times
National Survey of Family Growth

- det er ikke svært at finde, hvis du gider bruge 2 sek. Hvilke du nok ikke gider, siden du ikke har posted en eneste kilde selv.


[url=https://elementalenergy.substack.com/p/world-first-thorium-molten-salt-reactor]World First: Thorium Molten Salt Reactor in China confirmed[/url]

Påstanden om Molten Salt Nuclear Reactor er fra Financial Times (How China wants to create a 'Polar Silk Road' through the Arctic). Det er kun rygter, af hvilke grund jeg skriver "angiveligt"


https://zoom.us/j/91667468629?pwd=T2hGQVloWExQcDFBVEZYNEEvUjRWQT09

Sydkorea (Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) og Samsung Heavy Industries) siger også (i 2025) de har et design på en 174,000m³ LNG drevet af en lille modular molten salt reactor. [url=https://www.imarine.cn/199460.html]The world's first nuclear-powered LNG carrier has received certification (Mandarin)[/url]. Omend det vil tage nogle år at få den færdig.

Der er i øvrigt et dansk firma der arbejder på det: [url=https://www.copenhagenatomics.com/]Copenhagen Atomics[/url]. De har dog vist aldrig produceret noget.

----------
The Events table should also have an "importance" column, with values: LOW, MIDDLE, HIGH. Which should also be included in the Audit Trail table.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Page Task: The Artifact tab. There should be a button to add an artifact to the task. This should open a pop-up. similar to the one of the Artifact page under Task/Add to Task.
A Search field, and a list of current tasks to select from.

Page Profile: The events generated when making changes to a task, should be connected to the task, not the profile

Page Organization: The events generated when making changes to a task, should be connected to the task, not the organization

Page Organization: The events generated when making changes to a profile, should be connected to the profile, not the organization


Page Organization: I get this error when trying to add a task

* Page Artifact : When creating a new Artifact, it should create an Audit Event with LOW importance.

* Page Audit Trail: the table is too wide. It exceeds the screen's width. Possible because the message column and entity columns have no width restrictions.

* Page Incomming Files. The table needs pagination. Maximum 10 rows per page.

* Create three new pages: 1) About Compliance Circle; 2) Privacy Policy; 3) Terms of Service

Create content for Privacy Policy and Terms of Service
